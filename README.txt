Treadmill control custom routines: 

create2pTriggerTable.m

This code generates a master control table to control events (whisker stimuli, visual stimuli, and blinking of synchronization LED) based on timing from the frame clock of the microscope. 

wisimArduinoStream.py 

This code facilitates whisker stimulation and LED blinking, tracks the velocity of the treadmill, and logs time stamps for all events (including treadmill movements). 

visStim.py

This code facilitates visual stimuli.
